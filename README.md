# RiboAlloc

A minimal model of ribosome allocation between endogenous and synthetic genes within a cell. The code is developed in MATLAB and has been tested using MATLAB 2014b. Equations defining the model is defined in `riboalloc.m` and an example of how this is called is given in `riboalloc_example.m`.
